# DLfuse: Distributed Lag Data Fusion for Estimating Ambient Air Pollution

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian spatially-varying (and spatiotemporally-varying) distributed lag regression analysis to predict ambient air pollution concentrations at new spatial locations and times. The method uses lagged average gridded air pollution estimates as predictor information and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "DLfuse_Model_Details" and "DLfuse_Examples" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
